Hi! My name is **Ricky**, and this is my personal site. 

I am currently working as **Principal Engineer / Head of Infrastructure** at NiceDay Nederland. 

I am interested in technology (especially programming and infrastructure), electronics, and a little bit of history. 

I am also a **licensed amateur radio**. My callsign is YD1EXP.
