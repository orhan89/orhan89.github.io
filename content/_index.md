Hi! My name is Ricky, and this is my personal site. 

I am currently working as Principal Engineer / Head of Infrastructure at NiceDay Nederland. 

I am interested in technology (especially programming and infrastructure), electronics, and a little bit of history. 

I am also a licensed amateur radio with callsign YD1EXP.
